## **Example Usage**

### **Defining and Running Agents**
```javascript
import { Agent, TaskManager } from 'zytron-js';  

// Define an agent  
const agent = new Agent({  
  name: 'MarketAnalyzer',  
  task: 'Analyze market trends',  
  tools: ['API_Integration', 'DataProcessor'],  
});  

// Assign task manager  
const manager = new TaskManager();  
manager.addAgent(agent);  

// Execute task  
manager.run('Retrieve crypto market insights');
```

### **Web3 Integration with Ethereum**
```javascript
import { Agent, Web3Connector } from 'zytron-js';  

// Initialize Web3 connection  
const ethConnector = new Web3Connector({  
  provider: 'MetaMask',  
});  

// Create blockchain-enabled agent  
const blockchainAgent = new Agent({  
  name: 'DeFiAgent',  
  task: 'Automate cross-chain swaps',  
  tools: [ethConnector],  
});  

blockchainAgent.run('Perform asset swap on Ethereum Mainnet');
```
